LINUX 4.1:

The book was originally written for the Linux 3.18.x kernel. Since then
Linux 4.1 has come out with a completely revised DMA API.  This git branch
will contain a revised Linux kernel module needed by PiSpy in order to
function as a Logic Analyzer. All the other software is used in the book
unaffected by this change.


STATUS:

In a few days, this branch will reflect a working version of PiSpy and
its Linux character driver for Linux 4.X. So please stay tuned. If you are
reading this now, please be aware that it is not quite ready yet.
