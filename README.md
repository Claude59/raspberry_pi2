## Raspbian Linux 4.x Kernel Warning:

Something has changed in the way that the 4.1.14 Raspbian Linux kernel allocates DMA. I have resolved most of the issues related to this but kernel issues remain. If you wish to build the book's kernel module and use PiSpy, continue with the 3.x Raspbian Linux kernels for now. Check back from time to time for updates.
